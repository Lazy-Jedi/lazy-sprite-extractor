Make sure you have the Unity Sprite Editor package installed that comes with the Unity 2D Packages.

To setup your spritesheet correctly you need to apply some of the following changes.

Changes that are denoted with an asterisk (*) are required!

### * Sprite Mode
+ Multiple

### White Space Settings
+ To Allow White Space set Mesh Type to Full Rect.
+ To Remove White Space set Mesh Type to Tight.

### Read/Write Mode
+ Enable Read/Write mode

It's ok if you forget to do this step the sprite extractor will automatically apply this setting to your spritesheet if it has not been enabled.

### Slicing

+ Click Sprite Editor
+ Slice your Spritesheet Manually by selecting regions you wish to extract
+ Slice your Spritesheet Automatically by either
  + Using the Automatic option - Unity automatically finds individual sprites in the spritesheet (may not work as desired)
  + Using the Cell Size of the individual Sprites
  + Using the Number of Columns and Rows the Spritesheet is made up of
+ Apply any padding and offsets that you may require
+ Click Apply once you are done!

Once this is done, you can use either the Sprite Extractor Tool or Quick Extraction to Extract the Sprites.
